=== What is this?

This is a detached branch of the project ModeShape (http://www.jboss.org/modeshape).

The project has been developed starting from the version 2.4.0.Final.

For the stone project we started modifying the code so that we could use it
inside an OSGI container (Apache Felix).
We didn't submit our patches (yet) to the master project, we're still unsure
whether these patches are usefull or not to a broader audience.

To see the details of what we changed, please take a look at the CHANGES.diff file.
