=== What is this?

This is a detached branch of the project ModeShape (http://www.jboss.org/modeshape).

For the stone project we started modifying the code so that we could use it
inside an OSGI container (Apache Felix).
We didn't submit our patches (yet) to the master project, we're still unsure
whether these patches are usefull or not to a broader audience.
