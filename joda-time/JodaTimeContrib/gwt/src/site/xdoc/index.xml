<section name="Joda Time - GWT port">
<p>
<a href="/index.html">Joda-Time</a> provides a complete quality alternative
to the JDK date and time classes.
<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit">Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</a>  
is a development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications,
which allows you to write client-side applications in Java and deploy them as JavaScript. 
</p>
<p>
This sub-project was setup to be able to use <strong>Joda-Time in a GWT environment</strong>.
To make this as easy as possible, at server side it makes no difference whether you use Joda-Time or Joda-Time-GWT.
And for the client side, in the browser, Joda-Time-GWT maximizes the amount of code that you can still use in a transparent way. 
Inevitably there are some exceptions though. They are discussed in detail in the <a href="userguide.html">user guide</a>.
