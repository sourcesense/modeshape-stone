	      <para>
	      	Another sequencer that is included in ModeShape is the <emphasis role="strong">modeshape-sequencer-mp3</emphasis> sequencer project.
					This sequencer processes MP3 audio files added to a repository and extracts the <ulink url="http://www.id3.org/">ID3</ulink>
				 	metadata for the file, including the track's title, author, album name, year, and comment.
					After extracting this information from the audio files, the sequencer then writes this structure into the repository,
					where it can be further processed, analyzed, searched, navigated, or referenced.
	      </para>
