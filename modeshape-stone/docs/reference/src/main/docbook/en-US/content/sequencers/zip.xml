  <title>ZIP File Sequencer</title>
    <para>
    	The ZIP file sequencer is included in ModeShape and extracts the files and folders contained in the ZIP archive file,
		extracting the files and folders into the repository using JCR's <code>nt:file</code> and <code>nt:folder</code> 
		built-in node types.  The structure of the output thus matches the logical structure of the contents of the ZIP file.
    </para>
	<para>
		To use this sequencer, simply include the <code>modeshape-sequencer-zip</code> JAR
		in your application and configure the &JcrConfiguration; to use this sequencer using something similar to:
